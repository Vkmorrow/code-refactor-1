# Code Refactor 1

Improving semantics on HTML, accessibility and optimizing CSS

## Description
This project is supposed to give the viewers of the webpage an easy view of the Horiseon sight. The viewers should be able to navigate easily through the page and be able to click linkks that will direct them to different areas of the site. Also, the site should include information below images describing what the images are so that viewers can picture what the image shows without actually seeing an image.
I have run into some issues while editing this site as you will see after accessing the links. Those issues will be fixed soon after I recieve the help that I need to make those changes.
